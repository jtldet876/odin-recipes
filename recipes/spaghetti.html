    <h1>World Famous Spaghetti</h1>
    <img src="homescreenify-sA3wymYqyaI-unsplash.jpg">
    <alt="Best Spaghetti"</alt>
        <p>The quintessential spaghetti dish is a harmonious marriage of al dente noodles and a vibrant, slow-simmered
            sauce that clings to every bronze-cut strand.</p>
        <p>Imagine a plate of <strong>"La Devozione,"</strong> a celebrated Neapolitan classic where the pasta is tossed
            in a velvety tomato sauce made from sun-ripened San Marzano tomatoes, fresh basil, and high-quality olive
            oil.</p>
        <p>Each bite offers a satisfying "snap" from the perfectly cooked wheat, balanced by the savory richness of the
            sauce and a generous dusting of sharp, salty Pecorino Romano or Parmesan cheese.</p>
        <p>Whether it's the rustic simplicity of garlic and oil in a classic Aglio e Olio or a hearty, meat-heavy
            Bolognese, the best spaghetti is defined by its ability to provide pure, aromatic comfort in every twirl of
            the fork.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Spaghetti Noodles</li>
            <li>Diced Tomatoes</li>
            <li>Hamburger</li>
            <li>Tomato Sauce</li>
            <li>Shredded Mozzeralla</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>Basil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Boil Water:</strong>Fill a large pot with 4–6 quarts of water and bring to a rolling boil.</li>
            <li><strong>Salt the Water:</strong>Add at least a tablespoon of salt to the water once it boils; it should
                taste like the sea.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Cook the Noodles:</strong>Add the spaghetti and stir to prevent sticking. Boil for 8–12 minutes,
                or according to package directions, until al dente.</li>
            <li><strong>Reserve Water & Drain:</strong>Before draining, reserve about 1 cup of the starchy pasta water.
                Drain the pasta in a colander, but do not rinse it.</li>
            <li><strong>Combine with Sauce:</strong>Return the noodles to the pot or add them directly to a pan of warm
                sauce.</li>
            <li><strong>Finish:</strong>Add a splash of the reserved pasta water to the sauce and noodles to help the
                sauce adhere to the pasta. </li>
        </ol>

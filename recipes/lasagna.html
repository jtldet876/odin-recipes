    <h1>Best Lasagna Recipe</h1>
    <img src="emanuel-ekstrom-flEUTTwGlJQ-unsplash (1).jpg" alt="Lasagna" </body>
    <h2>Better than Olive Garden</h2>
    <p>The ultimate lasagna is a masterpiece of comfort food, defined by a rich, slow-simmered Bolognese sauce—blending
        browned Italian sausage and ground beef with aromatics, red wine, and crushed tomatoes—layered between perfectly
        tender pasta sheets.</p>
    <p>It achieves the perfect balance of texture and flavor through a creamy mixture of ricotta, egg, and Parmesan,
        dotted throughout layers of gooey mozzarella, rather than relying on an overwhelming amount of cheese.</p>
    <p>The best technique involves layering with no-boil noodles to maintain an al dente texture, allowing the lasagna
        to rest for at least 30 minutes after baking at 350°F to ensure it sets properly and slices beautifully.</p>
